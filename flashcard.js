		// I would say though is to stay consistent with whichever set of rules you decide to follow.
		// Also, fun fact, you could remove every single semi-colon from this file and it would still work
		// exactly the same. This is because the JS compiler has a thing called automatic semi colon insertion
		// which basically means that it will go through your code and insert semi colons anywhere it thinks you forgot
		// to be them. It's a pretty wishy washy subject and is often the cause of confusion and ire. I'd encourage
		// you to read up on it when you get some free time (like that ever happens during a bootcamp...üòè)
